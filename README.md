## 🧠 What is TealDOS?

**TealDOS** is an open-source hobby operating system, designed from scratch by volunteers, with a mission to revive old computers and give them a fresh, usable experience. While visually inspired by Windows, TealDOS is *not* affiliated with Microsoft in any way.

Whether you're a tinkerer, a retro hardware fan, or just want a lightweight OS that works, TealDOS is here to power your machine with elegance and speed.
